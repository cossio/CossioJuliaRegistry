# MyPublicJuliaRegistry

My public Julia registry. Created using https://github.com/GunnarFarneback/LocalRegistry.jl.

To install this registry, run the following command in the Julia pkg REPL (once per Julia installation):

```julia
pkg> registry add https://github.com/cossio/MyPublicJuliaRegistry.git
```

This registry contains both public and [private](https://github.com/GunnarFarneback/LocalRegistry.jl/blob/master/docs/ssh_keys.md) packages.
